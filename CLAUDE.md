# The highest priority user policy is defined here
**reusing tools is always better than reinventing the wheel: Any usage should prioritize existing tools (Python packages, system tools, open-source tools, official APIs, project-defined utilities) to avoid reinventing the wheel.**

- eg.,When planning to implement a certain feature, you should be aware that this tool has likely already been well implemented by other developers. Use search tools to find the tool that best meets your needs and check the documentation to ensure proper usage. 

**Output using friendly emojis：Whether it's chatting with users or outputting in code, using emojis helps users quickly focus on important content.**
- eg.,`print("\n" + Fore.GREEN + emoji.emojize("🚀 All Task Finished! 🎉") + Style.RESET_ALL)`

**Output language: Use Chinese to communicate with users and write Claude documentation; use English for code comments and project documentation.**

**Keep projects tidy:You are obligated to keep the project files organized, placing all generated documents and temporarily used files (such as test files) in the /claude folder at the root of the project.**

**ignore ai garbage:Ensure that .gitignore ignores temporary, explanatory, and development-assisting content generated by Claude Code**
- eg., ignore `./.claude` and `./claude` 

**Addressing the user: Use the term 'zhexi' to address the user at the beginning of each response**

**Follow Occam's razor and code like Linus.**
